							<p>The time has come to fire up the four-stoke monsters once more as the first MotoGP test gets underway in Malaysia in just a few days time, with motogp.com bringing you comprehensive and exclusive coverage.</p>
							<p>Following a two day set-up period, three of the CRT teams that are switching to the now-available Magneti Marelli ECU will have two days running on the Sepang circuit to test their new electronics on the 3rd and 4th of February, ahead of the rest of the grid joining them.</p>
							<blockquote>For this, Avintia Blusens, Hiroshi Aoyama and Hector Barbera will be joined by Came IodaRacing Projects Danilo Petrucci and Lucas Pesek, as well as NGM Mobile Forward Racings Colin Edwards and Claudio Corti.</blockquote>
							<p>Throughout the ECU test period, motogp.com will bring you full reports of the days activities, as well as mid-day and full-day video highlights of how the riders got on. In addition to this, we will be talking to MotoGP Director of Technology Corrado Cecchinelli about the introduction of the new electronics, as well as to Bridgestone about their new CRT-specific softer rear tyre.</p>
							<p>Things will then hot up from the 5th, as the rest of the MotoGP premier-class grid joins the action to commence three days of testing that will give the first real indication of form ahead of this season. With Valentino Rossi back on the Yamaha, Marc Marquez jumping on the Repsol Honda, and Jorge Lorenzo and Dani Pedrosa finishing the season neck-and-neck, lap times will be relevant from the start. And with Ducati promising a new approach, and CRTs expected to up their game further, this pre-season is not one to miss.</p>
							<p>motogp.com will ensure you stay informed throughout. Daily video highlight updates, as well a mid- and full-day report will keep you abreast of all the action, whilst our corner-view series will bring you the best shots of MotoGP riders back at full lean for 2013. Daily rider interviews, as well as additional technical features will keep you glued to the screen until the test finishes on the evening of Thursday the 7th. Daily track times will be from 10am to 6pm local time, which is 3am to 11am CET.</p>

							<p>At the Repsol headquarters in Madrid, the Repsol Honda Team today officially unveiled its 2013 line-up as well as its RC213V for the forthcoming season.</p>
							<p>Before riders Dani Pedrosa and Marc Marquez and the new-liveried bike took to the stage, HRC Executive Vice President Shuhei Nakamoto explained that the bike was not a radical redesign, but a continual evolution from last season. With a 3kg weight increase to cope with, Nakamoto commented that the team had had ample time to prepare the machine for this season, sighting that the main differences are a bit more power, as well as better fuel efficiency. Yet the bike is still based on the model that was brought in for the Laguna Seca round last year for Pedrosa.</p>
							<blockquote>The event, which saw many familiar faces from the MotoGP paddock such as Dorna CEO Carmelo Ezpeleta, Alberto Puig and Emilio Alzamora, was witness to the bikes new colour scheme, which has veered away somewhat from the typical Repsol scheme that has been present over the years. With more red and white tones, it still retains the title sponsors feel, albeit with a new approach. Marquez commented the machine was "muy bonita" (very beautiful), whilst Pedrosa, who has been on the bike since 2006, said it was refreshing to see a new paint job.</blockquote>
							<p>Nakamoto told those present that he expects Pedrosa to continue his blistering form from the end of last year and challenge for the title, whilst saying that with Marquez's talent he expects the rookie to be on the podium. He acknowledged that Marquez was very quick over one lap, yet sighted tyre management as the main thing he will have to pick up.</p>
							<p>A slight change in the team's management structure has also occurred, with Livio Suppo having been announced as new Team Principal.</p>

							<p>A light dusting of snow welcomed the arrival of Andrea Dovizioso and Nicky Hayden at Madonna di Campiglio for the twenty-third edition of the Wrooom Press Ski Meeting.</p>
							<p>The riders arrived in Trentino behind the wheel of an Audi dressed in special Wrooom colours.</p>
							<blockquote>Tomorrow morning, the two Ducati Team riders will hold the first press conference of the event that symbolically marks the start of the international motorsports season.</blockquote>
							<p>Preparations are almost ready for the unveiling of the Desmosedici GP13, scheduled for tomorrow evening in a mountaintop chalet at Madonna di Campiglio. In the meantime, the bikes were transported up the mountain, clearly under wraps, behind a snowcat, arousing the curiosity of the skiers on the slopes.</p>
							<p>Wrooom 2013 will continue on Wednesday with press conferences for Bernhard Gobmeier, the new General Manager of Ducati Corse, and Stefano Domenicali (Ferrari Team Principal).</p>
							<p>Thursday, it will be the turn of the Ferrari drivers, whereas Fridays grand finale will feature a spectacular exhibition challenge, with the MotoGP riders and Formula 1 drivers facing off in karts on the towns frozen lake.</p>
